This program initializes the first two cells to 5 and 3
Then it adds 5 into the cell with the 3

If compiled with "debug" extension will also print the first
10 memory cells before and after the computation

+++++ first cell = 5
>+++ second cell = 3
# debug print if debug extension is enabled
[->+<]
# and again debug print if available
